# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to predict diabetes using deep learning models based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. We built and compared three models — ANN, LSTM, and Simple RNN — to classify whether a person is diabetic using features like glucose level, BMI, age, and more.
